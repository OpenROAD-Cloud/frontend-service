## Purpose
[The OpenROAD Project](https://theopenroadproject.org/) aims at providing a 24-hour, no-human-in-the-loop layout design 
for SoC, package and PCB with no Power-Performance-Area (PPA) loss. The cloud infrastructure set up at 
[OpenROAD Flow](https://flow.theopenroadproject.org/) makes the tools and designs accessible through
an easy-to-use web-based interface.

## Deployment on a Private Cloud
Although the publicly available platform enables our research and offers ease-of-use and latest 
improvements to users around the world, OpenROAD flow can be independently deployed on a private 
cloud infrastructure. 
Follow our [deployment guide](https://docs.flow.theopenroadproject.org/private-cloud.html) to get started. You can also seek [help](#help) below. 

## Contributing
To contribute to our project, have a look at the [project roadmap](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/flow.theopenroadproject.org/projects/1)
to get familiar with our plans. Our [developer guide](https://docs.flow.theopenroadproject.org/developer-guide.html) outlines important coding style and organization of the codebase.

In general, here are the skills and tracks you can contribute to:

- **Frontend development**: We build user-centric web-based interfaces. You can contribute to this track if you have
decent skills in `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript` and `JQuery`. 
Dare to modernize our frontend stack to `VueJS`, `Angular` or `React`? We would love to hear from you. 
- **Backend development**: Our REST APIs are built using `Python Django REST Framework`. 
In addition, there are some views rendered using `Django template system`. 
Contribute to this track if you are familiar with `Python`, `Djnago`, `REST APIs` and databases.
- **Cluster computing**: the main `flow runner` is deployed in a `Kubernetes` cluster. 
Contribute to this track if you have strong `Docker` skills and server/cluster adminstration seems like
housekeeping tasks for you.   
- **Testing**: writing unit tests, integration tests, and automating this process is at the heart of our
CI/CD pipeline. Contribute to this track to enhance the reliability of the platform.

Before submitting a `pull request`, get in touch with the project contributors to align what features you will
be working on.
